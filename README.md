# COVID-19 Simulator in a University
A program designed to simulate the effects and spread of COVID-19 during the height of the pandemic on a university. Currently, I have chosen to simulate Santa Clara University, so the rules, regulations, and population of that university will be applied. 
## Process
The simulation will span a month (30 days), with data appearing for each day in this timeline. The program also simulates the likelihood of contact between a person with COVID and without COVID, as well as if a person is vaccinated or not. The program also accounts for the likelihood of someone having symptoms, getting tested, time it takes to receive test results, number of days quarantining, and the chance of death. 
## Data
List of data received after each day:
1. Day number
2. Total COVID cases
3. Total vaccinated people with COVID
4. Total unvaccinated people with COVID
5. The margin of COVID cases accumulated on that particular day
6. The margin of people who are vaccinated and received COVID on that particular day
7. The margin of people who are unvaccinated and received COVID on that particular day
8. Number of people quarantining on that particular day
9. Number of people healed from COVID on that particular day
10. Number of deaths on that particular day
## Purpose of the Simulation
I developed this simulation when schools and universities went back to in-person learning, roughly around the height of the pandemic. I was curious to see what impact it may have on us students, as well as to brush up on my C++ skills.
